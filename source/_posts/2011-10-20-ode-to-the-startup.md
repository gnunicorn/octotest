title: "Ode to the Startup"
description: "Last week I presented 'Club der Beschleuniger eG' in public for the first time at the Usability- and Designer user group <a href='http://up.front.ug/'>upfront</a>&nbsp;in Berlin. I didn't want to do just another 'this is my startup and we do this and that'-kinda slide-show-presentation. Not only because they suck but also because we are too different - I never refer to the company as a 'startup' in the first place. Instead I presented a little <b>poem</b> I had created right after we founded, explaining the reasons that got me there. So that current and future members of our company known what the goal behind the company is. And well, as it was a designer user group I also created something visually appealing.


So, without any further introduction I present to you the <a href='http://www.techberlin.com/post/11605973919/ode-to-startups-its-poetry-time-above-a-poem'>re-recording I did for techberlin.com</a>..."

Last week I presented "Club der Beschleuniger eG" in public for the first time at the Usability- and Designer user group <a href="http://up.front.ug/">upfront</a>&nbsp;in Berlin. I didn't want to do just another "this is my startup and we do this and that"-kinda slide-show-presentation. Not only because they suck but also because we are too different - I never refer to the company as a "startup" in the first place. Instead I presented a little <b>poem</b> I had created right after we founded, explaining the reasons that got me there. So that current and future members of our company known what the goal behind the company is. And well, as it was a designer user group I also created something visually appealing.


So, without any further introduction I present to you the <a href="http://www.techberlin.com/post/11605973919/ode-to-startups-its-poetry-time-above-a-poem">re-recording I did for techberlin.com</a>:

and the live recording of the event. So that you can get a feeling about the atmosphere there. And as a prove I really did present it in front of other people:

I'd be happy to know what you think of it - just leave a comment.
