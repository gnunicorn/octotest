 * Belgian beer tastes really good
 * Belgian beer is also pretty strong
 * My french is good enough to understand these people
 * My french is not good enough to talk to them tho
 * Looking up where you need to go before actually trying to go there avoids paying a cap to go to a place you just have been to by train
 * Belgian fries are good
 * Most people there seems to think I am french and speak french to me instead of dutch/fleemish, which would be easier for me to understand actually
 * Booking a Hotel with easyjet works pretty well
 * Peeps in Brussels like old music from the 60s, 70s and early 80s - even heard it in a Kebap place..
 * printing the plane confirmation email also helps me to remember when the flight actually is
 * talking to people face to face from time to time helps a lot
 * I should print (private) business cards
 * Four stars for a hotel actually mean a lot in Brussels
 * There is a free (as in sex) NextStep/OpenStep (Objective-C) Compiler by the Gnu-Project. It is called "GnuStep" and the people working on it are trying to become Apple Obj-c compatible asap.
 * A lot of projects give away shirts for small donations, but no one gives pants....
 * People write the same software again just because they don''t like (know?) the language it is written in
 * If you want to have a FOSDEM Shirt in your size: arrive early! (same applies for certain Debian, Ubuntu and Firefox Shirts...)
 * Brussel looks great at night
 * FOSDEM is AWESOME
 * Totally! - [Stupid joke.](http://thetvdb.com/?tab=episode&seriesid=75760&seasonid=34610&id=423101&lid=7)
