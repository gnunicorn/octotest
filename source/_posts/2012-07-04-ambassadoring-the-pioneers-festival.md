This just in: I will be [the Ambassador to Berlin](http://pioneersfestival.com/about-us/ambassadors/?t=b464k#germany) for the [Pioneers Festival](http://pioneersfestival.com) end of October in Vienna, Austria. In case you haven't heard about it yet, it that three days festival formally known as [startup week vienna](http://www.startupweek2011.com/) run by the great [StartupLive Team](http://www.startuplive.in), for whom I already mentored their great weekend sessions in [Vienna](/2012/02/13/mentoring-startuplive-vienna) and [Copenhagen](/2012/04/05/mentoring-startuplive-copenhagen-this-time).

So if you have any questions, feel free to bug me and I'll do my best and use my Ambassadorship-Powers to get answers for you. But generally I can assure you it will be great and you really do not want to miss that one out. Especially when you are a startup looking for some serious media coverage and big investors pitching. But only the best 50 will be taken for the big [startup challange, so you better apply with the best you got](http://pioneersfestival.com/startups/challenge/?t=b464k). Good luck!
