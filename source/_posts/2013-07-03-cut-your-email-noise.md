During my time in Tel Aviv I was often woken up by some annoying loud noise, which sounded a lot like a car alarm. Though super annoying I noticed the sound a lot more often than people could possibly trying to steal cars and soon I learnt that it was actually the sound of a truck backing up backwards. Which kinda makes sense: in a city as noisy as this one, you can barely hear it, so it is just logical for a judge to rule they need to be louder and even noisier. But once you take a step back and look it at from the far, you realise, this just makes this city even more noisy and soon, someone else has to be louder and so on and so forth. That same principle also applies to notification emails.

During my time in Tel Aviv I was often woken up by some annoying loud noise, which sounded a lot like a car alarm. Though super annoying I noticed the sound a lot more often than people could possibly trying to steal cars and soon I learnt that it was actually the sound of a truck backing up backwards. Which kinda makes sense: in a city as noisy as this one, you can barely hear it, so it is just logical for a judge to rule they need to be louder and even noisier. But once you take a step back and look it at from the far, you realise, this just makes this city even more noisy and soon, someone else has to be louder and so on and so forth. That same principle also applies to notification emails.

It **has become a recent trend of more and more startup to send everyone reminders and notifications about every nitty gritty thing that is going on**. While at the same time it is this same group of people complaining of having too much email to deal with and less and less time to focus. It is them who are sending those emails, though in their own opinion there should actually be less in the first place. I call that pathetic. And harmful is even harmful for your business.

Just think about the city analogy again: how do people adapt to more noise? They get numb and care even less, so you need to scream even louder to get them to notice. So with every useless notification you send towards your user, you condition them a little bit more to care just a little bit less, as it makes it this little bit harder to know whether emails from you are important or not. **By notifying the user about everything you make it harder for them to find the signal in the noise**.

And it is not true, that the sender doesn't know which are signal and which are noise. But in the notification setup we put "someone uploaded a picture" and "inform me about feature updates" on the same level as "whenever I received a direct message" - though two are noise and one is signal and we know it. And by making them disable those opt-out, we tell them: look, we know we spam you and we don't care. But, **if you want your customer to care: send them less messages and focus on the signal and what really matters to them**.]
