title: "Two Things About The German Tech Startup (Job) Market"
description: "Lately I've met quite a few people from silicon valley coming to Berlin to check out the startup scene. Thought the local Startups scene is often compared to the one over the great lake, a few things are very different. Often mentioned are the missing network of founders and investors as well as longer history in tech entrepreneurship.

Lately I've met quite a few people from silicon valley coming to Berlin to check out the startup scene. Thought the local Startups scene is often compared to the one over the great lake, a few things are very different. Often mentioned are the missing network of founders and investors as well as longer history in tech entrepreneurship. But **today I want to discuss two urgent problems concerning the tech job market in Berlin,** which **not even the local founders understand entirely**, as far as I can see. But we need to understand their roots to be able to tackle them and find solutions.

 **Very few tech-founders**

When you look at the number of students in computer science and how many tech founders you have you quickly notice a huge difference between Germany and other places like the valley. One of the reasons for that lies in the university courses in Germany (and Europe):&nbsp;you learn about the bigger picture, the higher concepts, the theories of computers and informatics here. As the term "computer science" describes it so very well: after your studies you know your way around the science part. But you **don't learn to code**, to **design a software architecture**, to **create a product nor a UI** that users understand. **Product development is not part of these courses, don't event hink about entrepreneurial or administrations**.


As a result **IT graduates in Germany have almost no experience in Software Development nor knowledge of business**. There is a good reason why established companies like Microsoft, SAP or IBM expect a transition period of 6-12 months for a graduate in their company before they can even consider him able to be part of a development team. But at the same time there is a huge demand for software and hardware engineers world wide. So **established companies **don't only **pay very well **in this sector they** also **give techies a lot of freedom** and ensure they have fun at work. So there are **only very few techies capable and interested in founding a company&nbsp;**as product development and business are rarely part of studies in informatics in europe (other than at MIT or Berkley) and the tradeoff is very high.


Though **back in the first dot-com bubble*** even in Germany a **lot of techies founded or co-founded companies**. Being really happy to find someone to take care of the business-side of things most took MBAs and took care of the non-business-part only. Only to learn that they got **screwed over by their business "partner" big time when things heated up**.&nbsp;This experience became part of the collective memory of hacker scene here. It is rooted in there so deeply that even though it is a totally new generation of hackers now they **are still alienated by business and marketing people **and simply **consider them not trustworthy**. The second big reason why so few hackers are interested in taking their idea up another level and found a company. **Most tech innovation** still happens hidden from the majority of the society and even **hidden** from the startup scene in the **members-only-area of hacker spaces**.

**Barely design-driven entrepreneurship**

Secondly there is a huge **lack of good designers** in the startup community in europe, although the roots for this are to found totally elsewhere. They have not had the bad experience in the 2001-bubble and product development is actually a huge part of the design process. Well, yeah, **similar to developers not learning anything about design, designers barely learn how to code during their studies**. But that ain't the reason, the reason lies within in the system: **While the arts are free, studying design is not.**


Almost any **half-way decent university in europe offering** some kind of (web-) **design course** is privately run and therefore **very expensive**. And most of them take up so much time that there isn't any time left for a job on the side. Of course there are scholarships but they barely cover everything, so many, many design student **take a student loan** and you can get them easily. **Leaving them with a huge debt** (100k-120k isn't that&nbsp;unusual&nbsp;I was told) when they graduate. So even though they are totally in-experienced they have to ask for a lot of money just to pay off the loan and have enough money left for the rent. They simply **can't work for shares or lowered cash because they just can't afford it**. That is why design is so expensive in europe.

 **But what does that mean?**

Because of all of that, it is **very hard to find those passionate Tech-Teams** with this great solution for a common problem that you just need to give some money for marketing and everything else just happens on its own. Even if you find a founder team of tech people, you probably have to help them a lot with the business- and marketing-side of things. But **most startups are founded with a lack of technical skills** by business administration graduates, who "see a market for it" somewhere and **just need "someone to program it"** anyway. Though there is **no one willing to do that**. And just opening another startup-jobs-offerings-website isn't going to change that. There are just so many more benefits - for a developer - to work for big corp than for your startup (as I showed earlier).


But there are things we can do. And with reading this article down to this point, you made the **first and most important step already**:&nbsp;realizing&nbsp;that the market is different than in the valley, that **great product aware tech-teams are the exception** and **most techies need help with their business-side**. The **second thing** is about **emphasizing&nbsp;the offerings**&nbsp;big corp can't make to developers: do a startup is about **making a dent in the universe**. And by that hope to find those few that are willing to take upon that risk and join a startup instead of heading for the safe bet at IBM or SAP.


And then there is the third and probably **hardest part**: **be honest and fair with the techies**. I already told you, that there is a huge distrust from developers against business people. And unless we can change that nothing is going to change. So, **tell your techie co-founder the truth**, **tell him to get a lawyer** (or talk to me about the gig**) for the contract, **give her the shares she really deserves**, **talk about exist-strategies openly** and **negotiate in his&nbsp;favor**&nbsp;when there is an investor. In short: **stop screwing with him**.


When we do that, there is a real chance more techies are willing to join the startup scene and help create awesome products.
