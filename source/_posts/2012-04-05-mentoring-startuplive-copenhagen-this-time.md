Wow. [Mentoring StartupLive Vienna]({{HOME_PATH}}2012/02/13/mentoring-startuplive-vienna/) was just amazing. Such an amazing crowd, so motivated people. I am seriously blown away - haven't seen such an insipered and productive group of people coming together for a full weekend (some even sleeping there) to work on their ideas. So amazed by it, I directly volunteered to do the same again, when the organiser of StartupLive Copenhagen asked me to join them later this month. So, yeah, I'll be [mentoring at StartupLive Copenhagen](http://startuplive.in/copenhagen/1/judges/) April 20th, 2012 again. Really looking forward.

And pro Tip: if you ever get the chance to participate at a StartupLive in your city, DO IT. Those organisers do an amazing job in creating exactly that productive vibe I am missing from those startup parties we do so often here in Berlin...
