Trying to settle in here in Berlin. And what better way to get to know some local tech people than hosting an Event?

So in case you are interested in the upcoming Palm Pre and Development on its [WebOS](http://webos.org/) Platform - a smartphone completly run on web technologies - why don't you come to the [PreDevCamp](http://berlin.predevcamp.org) I'll be hosting in Berlin on August 8th this year. Oh, and if you have a good idea for a venue, please let me know!
